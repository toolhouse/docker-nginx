# nginx docker images

This is a [Toolhouse][toolhouse] fork of the [official Docker image for nginx][upstream], with changes that make it  more appropriate as a base image. 

The images are kept as close as possible to the official images. See the [official image readme][upstream-readme] for documentation.
